The Online Doctor Consultation &amp; Prescription System is a web-based application developed using Flask (Python) and MySQL that simulates a basic doctor consultation process. The system allows users to register, log in, submit their health symptoms, and receive an automated prescription similar to a real doctor’s recommendation for common illnesses.
